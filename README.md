# NBA Analytics
Welcome! This is a collection of my different NBA analytics projects, where I try to leverage the vast amounts of data available to create cool projects. Still a work in progress!
## nn-allstars
This project is relatively simple, just using a neural network with two hidden layers to predict who is going to be an all star. I was originally ging to use a RNN, but decided instead to just do a simple NN with 30 games of data (with 23 categories) flattened into a length 690 vector. Still a work in progress, but feel free to check it out!
